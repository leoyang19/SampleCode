# SampleCode
This is a folder with samples of coding work I have done as a student at UC Berkeley. 

workout1copy is a piece that works with Data Wrangling and Vizualization. In this assignment, I considered different ways to rank the NBA teams, from simple rankings based on a given observed variable, to rankings based on derived indicies like efficiency (i.e. EFF) or any other composite index.
I worked with data.frames/tibbles and produced plots, but also used the packegs "dplyr" and "ggplot2". 

workout2copy is piece on testing functions and strings. In this assignment, I worked on creating a set of different functions by creating functions, documenting functions with Roxygen comments, using if-conditionals, loop structures, and manipulating strings. I also implemented tests for each function using the "testthat" package.
